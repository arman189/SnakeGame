# SnakeGame
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. I created this game using pygame module in python.

# Installing

Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Pygame library

--> pip3 install pygame

# Running the application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.

--> python3 Snake\ Game.py

The difficulty variable can be changed with the values provided in the comment to set the difficulty level.

The rest of the code is properly commented and self explanatory. Tweaks can be made to change the play style or visuals of the game.
